#Polybot

![polybot banner](banner.png)

a work-in-progress hangouts bot written with [hangupsjs](https://github.com/tdryer/hangups), with a focus on variety of modules and ease of use.

It's primarily focused on groupchat-related functionality.

You can try its hosted demo on [google+](https://plus.google.com/114969566275981000493/about).

Uses `chat_modules` to interact with an abstraction of the hangupsjs api. Events are sent from an eventemitter in `index.js`.
